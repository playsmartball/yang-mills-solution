## Year 1-2: Clay Institute Path

### Prerequisites for Clay Institute Notification

**Wait until you have:**
- ✓ Peer-reviewed journal publication
- ✓ Independent verification (at least 1 other group)
- ✓ Lattice simulation results matching predictions
- ✓ Community consensus (mostly positive reception)
- ✓ Response to all major criticisms

### Clay Institute Submission Process

**Official Requirements:**
1. Published in peer-reviewed journal OR
2. Posted to arXiv + 2 years for community vetting

**Submission Package:**
- Published journal version
- Letter describing contribution
- List of supporting evidence
- Independent verification reports
- Response to criticisms

**Timeline:**
- Don't rush this!
- Better to wait 2 years with solid support
- Than submit early and get rejected

## Contingency Plans

### If Reception is Mixed

**Positive signals:**
- High download count
- Technical questions (not dismissals)
- Replication attempts
- Seminar invitations

**Concerning signals:**
- Fundamental errors identified
- No engagement from community
- Dismissive comments

**Response to criticism:**
- Take all feedback seriously
- Distinguish technical errors from philosophical disagreements

- Claim conspiracy

**Do:**
- Thank the person for finding it
- Assess severity honestly
- Post correction to arXiv if minor
- Withdraw and fix if major
- Science self-corrects - embrace this
