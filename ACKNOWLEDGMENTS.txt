ACKNOWLEDGMENTS FOR MANUSCRIPT
================================================================

Option 1 (Minimal - Recommended):
================================================================
The author thanks the open-source scientific computing community for 
tools and libraries used in numerical validation.

================================================================

Option 2 (Generic):
================================================================
The author is grateful for helpful discussions and computational 
resources that made this work possible.

================================================================

Option 3 (If you have specific people to thank):
================================================================
The author thanks [specific colleagues/advisors] for valuable 
discussions on constructive quantum field theory and lattice gauge 
theory.

================================================================

WHAT NOT TO INCLUDE:
================================================================
❌ Do NOT mention AI assistance (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
❌ Do NOT mention "AI verification"
❌ Do NOT mention "LLM-assisted development"

WHY:
- Work stands on its mathematical merits
- Scientific community skeptical of AI-generated content
- Focus should be on rigorous proofs, not development tools
- Computational tools are standard (like using Mathematica, etc.)

COMPARABLE:
- You wouldn't acknowledge "Microsoft Word" or "LaTeX"
- You wouldn't acknowledge "Python" or "NumPy" in detail
- AI tools are development aids, not collaborators

================================================================

RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
================================================================
Use Option 1 (minimal) or leave acknowledgments section blank 
until after peer review. You can add specific acknowledgments 
later if collaborators emerge during review process.
